require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// initiate client
$apiKey = 'replace_with_your_own_api_key';
$client = new \FH\PostcodeAPI\Client(new \GuzzleHttp\Client(), $apiKey);

// call endpoints
$response = $client->getAddresses('5041EB', 21);
$response = $client->getAddress('0855200000061001');

// Note that this call is only available with a premium account
$response = $client->getPostcodes('51.566405', '5.077171');
```
